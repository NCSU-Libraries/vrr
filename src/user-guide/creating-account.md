If you do not have a NC State Unity ID, create a non-NCSU account at <https://vcl.ncsu.edu/accounts/site.php/newaccount.php>. Enter your name and email address. Under "Please explain why you are requesting an account," enter: `Using Libraries virtual reading room.`

## Activate your account

After creating your account, you will receive an email from vcl_help@ncsu.edu requiring activation of your account within 3 days.

## Email us

Once you have activated your account, let us know by emailing library_specialcollections@ncsu.edu, and confirm which email address you used to sign up. **We will then enable access to the virtual reading room and get back to you in about 2-3 days.**
